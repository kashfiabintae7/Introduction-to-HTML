    <h1>Photosynthesis</h1>

    <p>
      Photosynthesis is a <mark>biological</mark> process that converts
      <mark>light energy</mark> into <mark>chemical energy</mark>. It occurs in
      plants, algae, and <mark>some types of bacteria</mark>.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works:</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>1. Light-dependent reactions</strong><br /><br />

      Chlorophyll in the thylakoid membrane absorbs light energy from sunlight.
      This energy is converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH
      molecules.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2. Light-independent reactions</strong><br /><br />

      The ATP and NADPH molecules produced in the light-dependent reactions are
      used in the light-independent reactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>3. Calvin cycle</strong><br /><br />

      Plants and algae use the Calvin cycle to convert carbon dioxide from the
      air into sugar.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Importance</strong><br /><br />

      Photosynthesis is essential for life on Earth because it provides energy
      and food for plants and animals.
